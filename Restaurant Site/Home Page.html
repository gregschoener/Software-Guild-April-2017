       <h3>     Joes's Family Restaurant was originally established
            in 1953 by Joe's father Joe Senior; who was a cook on 
            a Navy vessel during WWII. Upon returning home, he used
            his GI Bill to begin the resrtaurant. It has been a family
            owned and operated business every since. The menu has changed
            a bit over the years however the committemnt to providing 
            excellent food for a good price has remained the hallmark 
            of the business.
